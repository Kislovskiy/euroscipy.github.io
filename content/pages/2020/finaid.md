## Financial Aid Program


Would you really love to join EuroSciPy but can't afford it? We can help you!

Thanks to the support of the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/), 
the [EuroPython Society](https://www.europython-society.org/), 
and [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/) 
we are glad to give financial support to everyone who may need it in order to join the conference.

We offer three types of Financial Aid grants: 

- **Free ticket.** The ticket includes access to 2 days of trainings + 2 days of talks + 1 day of sprints + social event
- **Accommodation costs.**  We can cover the accommodation costs in a student house “Colegio Mayor Deusto”: individual room in the student residence with individual shower room for 26-31 of July (5 nights). More details at [Colegio Mayor web page](https://www.deusto.es/cs/Satellite/colegiomayor/en/colegio-mayor-1/facilities-and-services)
- **Travel costs.** We will partially cover the travel costs (transportation)

**Note**: the total grant (accommodation + travelling) will not exceed 300€ per person. 


### Grant Eligibility

Our program is open to all people with a lack of budget. We can give limited numbers of subsidies, that's why we will focus on the next criteria for evaluation:

- **Diversity**: we are looking for the most diverse EuroSciPy conference
- **Contributors**: speakers/trainers of EuroSciPy, active people from small Python communities, and contributors to community projects.
- **Economic factors**: students, unemployed or people with difficult economic situation
