# Schedule

While the definitive schedule is still not available yet, we provide a couple
of information as we know up-to-now.

### Tutorial

From the 24 tutorial sessions, we will reserve specific slots for some tutorial
giving introduction to the following packages/tools: Python, NumPy, PyTorch,
SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, scikit-image.

### Sprint

A one-day sprint is organized on September 2. Open source sprints are session
where maintainers and contributors (including first time contributors) meet,
and work together in improving the open source projects. This can include bug
fixes, new features, improvements to the documentation and others.

The definitive schedule is not yet known and more sprints will be added when
they are proposed. If you want to propose a sprint, please send us a message to
<a href="mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org">maintainers@euroscipy.org</a> .

Currently, the following projects already opt-in for the day:

- NetworkX
- scikit-learn
