# On-Site Child Care

We will provide an on-site child care for free. Children of preschool age and
babies older than two months can be accommodated.

### Registration

In order to organize this service, we need to get an accurate estimate of the
number of children by **August 14**. We therefore require you to get a free
ticket for this service. It is available at the bottom of the registration
page.
